  Title: How we turned a monolitic UI into multiple modular applications
  Description: >
    React is **not** cool.
    Spending efforts to convince people wary about the hype is not cool either.
    Spending less time chasing bugs **is** cool.

    Instead of praising both technology and change, I spent 3 afternoons to break up an existing Web application into a living and interactive styleguide.
    When I have been asked how I achieved this so quickly: I answered I created and assembled React components.

    Developing new features became faster as one would expect.
    But code reviews and maintenance time diminished as well.

    This talk is a journey towards that migration:
    - breaking up a common problem through incremental improvement
    - elevating the browserify pipeline to a first class citizen
    - making our interface and components reusable by default
    - building and integrating our shiny components in non-browserified applications

    Basically, this is a story on I turned *frustrated* developers into *happy* composers.
